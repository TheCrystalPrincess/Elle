It’s like dancing, jumping around,                                        running—and then there’s a room for TikTok, doing all these TikTok videos….” Sitting                                        on a plush rug on her living room ﬂoor, wearing wide-leg jeans and an oversize green                                        sweatshirt, Hammam has a spirited, inviting demeanor, her delivery marked by laughs                                        and hand gestures and frequently tilting her head to the side.                                            Hammam is 10 years into the whirlwind of being one of fashion’s most in-demand                                        models. Born and raised in Amsterdam to a Moroccan mother and Egyptian father,                                        she was scouted at 13, signed her ﬁrst contract at 16, and “it just got crazy from there,”                                        she says. As much as she tried to balance work and school—going to class when she was                                        home and joining via Skype when she was traveling—she admittedly “put [school] on                                        the back burner,” she says. Encouraged by high-proﬁle ﬁgures in fashion, she moved                                        to New York, made her debut walking Jean Paul Gaultier’s fall 2013 couture runway,                                        and opened Riccardo Tisci’s spring 2014 Givenchy show. In the years since, she’s                                        graced dozens of magazine covers, starred in campaigns for Chanel and Versace, and                                        collaborated on collections with Frame and Port Tanger. Earlier this year, she added                                        one of modeling’s most esteemed and covetable jobs to her portfolio when she was                                        selected as the newest face of Estée Lauder.                                            “This dream to be an Estée woman was always kind of in the back of my mind,” she                                        says. “I was like, ‘If you’re an Estée woman, that’s it, you’ve done it. Done; mic drop.’ ”                                        Being the brand’s ﬁrst Afro-Arab ambassador makes the contract especially mean-                                        ingful. “[This is] the representation that we need,” she says, “and it’s just awesome.”                                            The ﬁrst campaign photos are images a younger Hammam would have appreci-                                        ated. “I didn’t really see the representation of women who looked like me, so it was                                        very hard for me to think I was beautiful,” she says. Her ascent to supermodel-dom                                        has coincided with scrutiny of the fashion industry’s historic lack of diversity, but also                                        with its strides toward greater inclusion. “We can always do better,” she says of the                                        efforts, but in the decade since she started her career, she’s noticed a change. “Now,                                        if you look at most magazine covers, if you look at campaigns, you see a lot of diver-                                        sity, and that makes me really happy. [I’m] very proud to be one of the women who                                        maybe helped with that.”                                            The career that Hammam is deservedly proud of has allowed her to travel the                                        globe and support her once-struggling family. (“Sometimes we didn’t eat for a week,”                                        she says of her upbringing.) But does she ever feel like modeling conﬂicts with her                                        identity as a Muslim woman?                                            “Constantly,” she says. “From the beginning of my career, my mom always said,                                        ‘I want you to do this, but do it in a way where it’s always respectful to yourself and to                                        our religion.’ I went to this event not so long ago, and I wore this look, and my mom                                        was not happy about it. I ﬁnd myself in the middle all the time,” she says, lowering                                        her gaze and shaking her head.                                            Still, Hammam is keenly aware of how inﬂuential her visibility is, and passionate                                        about using it for good. “Nowadays with social media, you’re able to be more than                                        just a beauty and a model; you’re also able to share your thoughts and share what you                                        believe in,” she says. “[Using] my platform to just simply talk about who I am—being                                        Moroccan-Egyptian, being Muslim—that alone is already helping so many people.”                                        Helping them to feel seen, she says, and to conﬁdently chase their dreams.","This page: Dress, gloves by CAUSSE,       Opposite: Swimsuit, DIOR               ankle boots by MASSARO,            HAUTE COUTURE.

Early in her career, she found a men-                                        tor in Bethann Hardison. “When I ﬁrst met her, I fell in love immediately,” Hardison                                        says. “She has this kind of beauty that you don’t get tired of, [and] she learned to have                                        a presence at everything she does—whether it be in print or on the runway. She really                                        learned to be a great model.”                                            For a teenage Hammam, connecting with Hardison was pivotal. “At that time,                                        everything was so competitive,” Hammam says of the dynamic among Black models                                        at castings. “I would walk into a room and I would be super friendly—‘Hey, what’s up?                                        I’m Imaan’—[but] they weren’t really trying to be friends.” In retrospect, she realizes                                        that the icy reception had little to do with her, and more to do with the fact that hous-                                        es were rarely casting more than one Black model for a show. “It makes sense. If only                                        one girl’s being picked, of course you’re going to feel some type of way.”                                            To encourage a sense of camaraderie among emerging Black models, Hardison                                        put a bunch of them together on a group chat and regularly invited them to dinner.                                        “She made sure we all came together and sat,” Hammam remembers, “and we would                                        go to fancy-ass restaurants. She’s bougie, which I love about her. We’d show up at                                        The New York Edition hotel—it’s 20 models—and we would rent this room upstairs                                        [and] just sit around and talk. I think that was so beautiful and so nice. She’s a legend.                                        She’s opened so many doors for women of color, and still does today.” Hammam,                                        Hardison says, more than seized her opportunities—she worked tirelessly, not only                                        to elevate and sustain her career, but also to embody the sense of unity her mentor                                        hoped to establish. “She’s not a girl who is looking to compete with anybody,” Hardison                                        says. “She’s a girl who is looking to compete with herself and bring the others along.”                        “I didn’t really see the representation of                        women who looked like me, so it                 was very hard for me to think I was beautiful.”                                               Though Hammam “used to be out in the streets a lot,” frequently going out dancing,                                        she’s been spending much more time at home recently, in the apartment she bought                                        six years ago. “I don’t know if it’s me being a Libra, but I get bored really quickly of fur-                                        niture and colors and things. I change it up every half year.” Currently, two dark green                                        velvet couches are planted in her living room. Vaulted ceilings and massive windows                                        make for a space ﬂooded with light. She plans to get rid of the hanging chair next to                                        the credenza; “that was one of those Pinterest dreams,” she says. A City of God poster                                        and a photo of her taken by Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj lean against a wall, to be                                        hung up in the days to come. “Honestly, my apartment is my safe space, my safe hav-                                        en,” she says. “I love spending time here.”                                            If you follow Hammam on TikTok, perhaps you’ve seen glimpses of her open                                        kitchen, where she and fellow model Monrose ﬁlm themselves cooking. Letting the                                        camera roll while making a mango kunafa tart and Egyptian macaroni béchamel has                                        proven to be a manageable content venture amid a social media–fueled culture that                                        often stresses her out. “Sometimes I get crazy DMs saying, ‘You’re going to hell, you’re                                        selling your body.’ ” It doesn’t bother her to the extent that it did when she was a teenag-                                        er, but “I can’t sit here and be like, ‘Oh, it’s not doing anything to me,’ ” she says. “That’s                                        something that is really sad about social media.” On the other side of that coin, though,                                        are some pinch-me interactions—like Hammam connecting in her DMs with one                                        of her all-time favorite models, Yasmeen Ghauri. During one exchange, Ghauri asked                                        Hammam how she learned her runway walk. “I’m like, ‘Girl, from you!’ ”                                            Before Hammam resumes those walks and ﬁnds herself on set, she’ll be spending                                        time with her family in Morocco (she is one of six children from a blended family).                                        And given her innate curiosity, the refrigerator list back in New York seems likely                                        to keeping growing. Hammam volunteers with the Asiyah Women’s Center—an                                        organization that provides support and shelter for women impacted by domestic                                        violence—and frequents the Islamic Center at NYU for Friday prayer and lectures                                        from its imam, Khalid Latif. She is taking a Business English course through online                                        platform Perfectly Spoken and is learning Brazilian jiujitsu. “I’ve taken one class,                                        and it was crazy,” she says, going on to recount practicing choke holds on a man in                                        what sounds like an MMA match. She wondered if it was too intense for her. “I was                                        like, ‘Okay, I don’t know if this is what I should be doing.’ ” But she can’t resist doing                                        something new. “I’m still going to do it, because I think it’s a fun sport.”","Jumpsuit, pumps,                                                                                                                              JEAN PAUL GAULTIER                                                                                                                                HAUTE COUTURE                                                                                                                            BY HAIDER ACKERMANN.","HAIR BY HOS HOUNKPATIN AT THE WALL GROUP; MAKEUP BY FRANK B FOR HOME AGENCY; MANICURE BY MAKI SAKAMOTO AT THE WALL GROUP; SET DESIGN BY MARLA WEINHOFF STUDIO; PRODUCED BY SERLIN.","Opposite: Dress, FENDI                         COUTURE.
